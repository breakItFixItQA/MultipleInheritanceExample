# MultipleInheritanceExample
Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces Example in Java
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project demonstrates Multiple Inheritance in Java using interfaces.
In Java, multiple inheritance (inheriting from more than one parent) is achieved through interfaces, not classes.

It shows:

How a single class (Child4) can implement multiple interfaces (Interface1 and Interface2).

How properties (constants) and methods from multiple interfaces can be accessed and implemented.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Interface1:

Constant: commonTrait (String, public static final by default)

Abstract Method: method1()

Interface2:

Constant: uniqueSkill (String)

Abstract Method: method2()

Child4 class (implements Interface1 and Interface2):

Property: name (String)

Implements both method1() and method2() with custom behavior.

MultipleInheritanceExample class:

Contains the main() method.

Creates an instance of Child4.

Demonstrates calling properties and methods from multiple interfaces.

ðŸš€ How It Works
The Child4 class:

Implements both method1() (from Interface1) and method2() (from Interface2).

Defines its own property name.

The main() method:

Creates an object of Child4.

Calls implemented methods and accesses interface constants.
